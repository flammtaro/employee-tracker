# employee-tracker

## Description
- The goal of this project was to create an employee tracker that incorprates inquirer prompts, and sql databases than can be retrieved and added to

- I built this project in order to better understand how to use the combination of inquirer terminal functions and sql schema/seed/query populating and linking

- What I learned on this project is that the syntax for the database queries can be quite complicated, and that reading from bottom to top can add some clarity to their functionality
